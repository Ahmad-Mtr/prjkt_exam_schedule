`Read the Instructions below`
### Some Tips:
    . Copy your Courses codes and names from MyGJU --> Schedule
    . Capitlization isn't important at all
    . Type atleast 3 characters in Code/Name sections to succesfully find their info (Single or Multi)
### Searching for a single Course
1. Write the Course's Code, (no need for the full code, minimum of 3 characters) --> `cs33`
2. Write that Course's Name (again, no need for the full name) --> `line`
3. `Find Course info`   // Output Course: `CS332 Linear Algebra...` 
### Searching for multiple Courses
1. Write the Codes (separated by commas only) --> `CS116,cs363,ene212`
2. Write the Names (separated by commas only) --> `computing,database man,linear`
3. Check `Search Multiple Courses`
4. `Find Course info`   // Output Courses Info: `CS116, Database..., Linear Algebra, Circuits II, CS115`
